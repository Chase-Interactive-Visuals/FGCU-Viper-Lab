# FGCU Viper Lab

## Project Overview
This Unity VR project was created by Brendan Chase, founder of Chase Interactive Visuals, LLC, to support and mentor the Viper Lab at Florida Gulf Coast University (FGCU). The Viper Lab is a VR club focused on advancing skills in Software Engineering and VR/AR development. The project serves as a hands-on introduction to creating VR applications in Unity, covering foundational setup, scripting techniques, and runtime interactions.

## Features

- **Comprehensive Setup Guide**: Step-by-step instructions for installing and configuring essential libraries and packages for VR development.
- **Sample Scenes**: Pre-built Unity scenes demonstrating various VR functionalities.
- **Educational Scripts**:
  - Informative comments explaining key functions and logic.
  - Console log statements to visualize script behavior during runtime.
  - Examples of how to modify and interact with scripts in real-time.
- **Interactive Learning**: Designed to teach students how to create their own VR applications while fostering best practices in coding and project management.

## Getting Started
